         <h2> Reviews </h2><!-- The reviews from people who went on vacation  -->
        
        <blockquote> " The beach was great. It's really that white powdery sand; and the water is Caribbean Blue. It's only 2' - 4' deep for hundreds of yards out to sea. Several times per day, there will be a machine (or guys with rakes) cleaning up any seaweed that washes up. " - Megan </blockquote>
        <blockquote> " All of the food was very good. Even the breakfast buffet had nice selections that changed a little bit each day. In mid-February it was mid 80's in the daytime; and high 70's at night. There was always (yes always) a breeze or outright wind. But, the wind made for absolutely 0 bugs; and it kept you cool when out in the sun " - Sarah</blockquote>
        <blockquote> "  We were there in the high season but with the lay out the resort it never felt crowded. The pool was clean, everything was clean, there were no bugs when we went. The beach is very nice with no waves, but does have some seaweed spots. Amenities were nice, things were clean and the beach is spectacular.We would definitely recommend this to others.
